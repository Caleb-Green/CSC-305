Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report
Artemis Financial, a consulting firm specializing in financial planning—covering savings, retirement, investments, and insurance—has enlisted Global Rain to modernize their software and enhance its security protocols. As experts in custom software design and development, we have undertaken a thorough vulnerability assessment to ensure the robustness of their systems.

One of my key contributions was conducting a comprehensive review of potential vulnerabilities through static testing and integrating Maven Dependency-Check. This proactive approach allowed us to identify vulnerabilities before they could be exploited, thereby establishing a strong security foundation for Artemis Financial. Ensuring software security not only builds client trust but also upholds the company's reputation and validates its commitment to excellence.

The most valuable aspect of this vulnerability assessment was learning and implementing various security techniques. Some of these tools, like creating a self-signed certificate, were new to me, making the process both challenging and rewarding.

In addition to reviewing the dependency check, we enhanced security by implementing cryptographic hash algorithms. I selected the SHA-256 algorithm and incorporated checksum verification into our code. Furthermore, we ensured secure communication by using a self-signed certificate created with Java's Keytool in Eclipse.

To verify the effectiveness of our security measures, I reran the dependency check, comparing the results with the initial assessment to identify any new or unresolved vulnerabilities.

The experience of creating and using self-signed certificates will be invaluable in future projects. Moreover, the skills gained from refactoring code and generating comprehensive reports demonstrate my ability to adapt to client needs and select the most suitable encryption algorithms for their requirements. This project not only showcased my technical capabilities but also my capacity to address and resolve complex security challenges for Artemis Financial.
